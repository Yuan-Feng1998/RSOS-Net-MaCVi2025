# RSOS-Net

## RSOS-Net: Real-time Surface Obstacle Segmentation Network for Unmanned Waterborne Vehicles

### Introduction

Due to water-surface reflection, wake and sun glitter, an unmanned waterborne vehicle (UWV) faces a long-standing challenge in identifying water-surface obstacles especially with small-scale appearance. In this paper, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, a real-time surface obstacle segmentation network (RSOS-Net) is created to enable online surface-obstacle detection for a UWV. Primarily, the improved lightweight feature pyramid network structure is deployed to flexibly accommodate significant scale-variations and enhance focus on small obstacles, simultaneously. To address visual ambiguities caused by water-surface disturbances, the fast pyramid pooling module (FPPM) and attention-based feature fusion module (AFFM) are holistically devised within lightweight encoder and decoder, respectively. Accordingly, the FPPM is able to distinguish obstacles from sun glitters by capturing both local and global contextual information via cascaded pooling, while the AFFM can rule out reflections by virtue of channel-spatial attention mechanism augmenting detailed features and spatial locations. Notably, the RSOS-Net secured first place in the the 3rd USV-based Embedded Obstacle Segmentation Challenge, with official results available at \url{https://macvi.org/workshop/macvi25/summary}.
