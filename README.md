# RSOS-Net

## RSOS-Net: Real-time Surface Obstacle Segmentation Network for Unmanned Waterborne Vehicles

### Introduction

RSOS-Net is a real-time surface obstacle segmentation network designed for unmanned waterborne vehicles. Utilizing deep learning and computer vision techniques, it accurately segments surface obstacles, providing crucial information for autonomous navigation and safe operation of unmanned waterborne vehicles.

### Data

Download the LaRS dataset: [https://lojzezust.github.io/lars-dataset/](https://lojzezust.github.io/lars-dataset/)

The dataset contains annotated images and corresponding obstacle labels for training and testing RSOS-Net. Please ensure that the data is downloaded and organized correctly according to the dataset instructions.

### Experimental Results
#### Segmentation Results under Water Surface Reflection and Glare Conditions
